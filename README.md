## Introduction  
Handy Hub is a web application designed to connect users with skilled workers such as electricians, plumbers, masons, painters, and laborers. It aims to simplify the process of finding reliable workers while providing a platform for workers to showcase their skills and receive job opportunities.  

## Problem Statement  
Finding skilled workers is often difficult due to the lack of a centralized system. Traditional methods, such as asking for recommendations, are time-consuming and unreliable. Customers also struggle to verify workersâ€™ skills and trustworthiness, while workers miss job opportunities due to outdated communication methods.  

## Project Objectives  
- **Easily find skilled workers**: Connect users with reliable professionals.  
- **Worker rating system**: Allow customers to rate and review workers.  
- **Optimize worker abilities**: Provide job recommendations based on skills.  
- **Customer-friendly service**: Ensure an intuitive and efficient user experience.  

## Features  
- User roles: **Admin**, **Customer**, **Worker**  
- **Customer functionalities**:  
  - Register and search for workers  
  - View worker profiles, ratings, and reviews  
  - Contact and book workers for jobs  
  - Provide feedback and ratings  
- **Worker functionalities**:

  - Manage job schedules  
- **Admin functionalities**:
